Second, Pat dry chicken wings liberally with paper towels, squeezing out as much moisture as you can. Transfer them to a large bowl.Third, In a small bowl, combine the baking powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper together, whisking well to combine, and sprinkle the mixture over the wings. Toss wings through the baking powder mixture until evenly coated. Fourth, Arrange on rack, leaving about one inch of space between each wing. Fifth, Bake for thirty minutes; flip and continue to cook until crisp and golden brown, (about twenty-thirty minutes longer), until golden browned and crispy. Sixth, While wings are cooking, whisk together hot sauce, butter and sugar. Toss wings through the sauce to evenly coat. Seventh, Serve wings immediately with blue cheese dressing or ranch dressing, and celery sticks.
